Hi !! Hey there! I'm a DevOps Engineer based in New Delhi with over 4 years of experience building, automating, and scaling infrastructure. I'm passionate about learning new thingsâ€”whether it's a cutting-edge cloud tool, an emerging AI trend, or just a cool way to streamline CI/CD pipelines.

I thrive at the intersection of development and operations, always looking for smarter, faster, and more efficient ways to deliver software. Cloud computing, infrastructure as code, container orchestrationâ€”you name it, Iâ€™m into it.

Beyond tech, I'm a massive foodie who lives for great flavors, football matches, and long music sessions. This blog is my space to share insights, experiments, tips, and thoughts from my DevOps journey (and maybe a bit about food and football too ðŸ˜„).
