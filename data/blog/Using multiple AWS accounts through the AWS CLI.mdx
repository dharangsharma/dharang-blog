summary: A walkthrough to use multiple AWS accounts through the AWS CLI — one main account and two others accessed via IAM roles
---

# Introduction

You should use named profiles in your AWS CLI configuration `(~/.aws/config and ~/.aws/credentials)`. Here's how to set this up step by step:

## Configure the Main Account

This account will contain your access keys.

Run:

```ts:bash
aws configure --profile main-account
```

Then enter:

- Access Key ID
- Secret Access Key
- Region (e.g., us-east-1)
- Output format (e.g., json)

This will populate `~/.aws/credentials` and `~/.aws/config` like:

```ts:~/.aws/credentials
[main-account]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_MAIN_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_MAIN_SECRET_KEY
```

```ts:~/.aws/config
[profile main-account]
region = us-east-1
output = json
```

## Add Role-Based Accounts

Assuming the main account lets you assume a role in the two other accounts.

### Example:

- Role name in other account: OrganizationAccountAccessRole
- Account IDs: 111111111111, 222222222222

Add the following to your `~/.aws/config` file

```ts:~/.aws/config
[profile account-one]
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole
source_profile = main-account
region = us-east-1

[profile account-two]
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole
source_profile = main-account
region = us-east-1
```

✅ source_profile tells the CLI to use the credentials from main-account to assume the role.

## Using the Profiles

Now you can use any of the accounts like this:

```ts:bash
aws s3 ls --profile main-account
aws s3 ls --profile account-one
aws s3 ls --profile account-two
```

Or you can set the profile temporarily for your session:

```ts:bash
export AWS_PROFILE=account-one
aws s3 ls
```
