# Introduction

Since a DevOps engineer needs to manage multiple kubernetes clusters, here is a quick walkthrough to merge Kubernetes Kubectl config files thus allowing us to keep only one Kubectl config file in `(~/.kube/config)`. Here's how to set this up step by step:

## Make a copy of your existing config

```ts:bash
cp ~/.kube/config ~/.kube/config.bak
```

## Merge the two config files together into a new config file

```ts:bash
KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config:/path/to/new/config

kubectl config view --flatten > /tmp/config
```

This tells kubectl to use both config files `(~/.kube/config and /path/to/new/config)` together they are merged virtually for the following command.

This does the following:

- **kubectl config view:** Displays the merged configuration from all the files listed in KUBECONFIG.
- **--flatten:** Ensures that all referenced files (like user auth info or clusters that may point to separate files) are flattened into a single self-contained config file.
- **/tmp/config:** Redirects the output into a new standalone kubeconfig file.

You now have a new file at /tmp/config that:

- Includes all contexts, users, and clusters from both original kubeconfig files.
- Is self-contained (no external references).
- Can be used as a unified kubeconfig by itself.

## Replace your old config with the new merged config

```ts:bash
mv /tmp/config ~/.kube/config
```

This command moves the merged kubeconfig you created earlier from /tmp/config to your default kubeconfig location `~/.kube/config`, effectively replacing your existing kubeconf

## After Running

You can verify everything worked by running:

```ts:bash
kubectl config get-contexts
```
